This is a Memory Game containing two levels
 When the app starts, the player sees the User interface for Level 1
 with two rows containing five cards each and displaying a default image.
 The user can click on a Image Button and then it displays an image an waits for the user to
 click on another Image Button. After the second click is detected, the program analyzes
 the pair of images and if it is a match, the cards stay flipped and a Toast informs the user that a                                                          pair was found. If the Images in the Image Buttons do not match, the game pauses for two
seconds and then the Image Buttons are reset to the default image. When the user finds 5 pairs,
the Level 2 activity starts. A click on the Reset button located in the Action Bar will shuffle
the Images  and change all Images Buttons to display the default image, hence
restarting the game and all variables
